To be documented...

A repository (e.g. [api.librepcb.org](http://api.librepcb.org)) holds a list of available libraries in the internet. The libraries must be hosted as Zip files, for example on the Releases page of a GitHub repository. The application will download these Zip files and extract them into the `libraries/remote/` directory in the workspace.
