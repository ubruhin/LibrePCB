# Library Elements {#doc_library_elements}

The LibrePCB library system knows following elements:

- [Component Category](@ref librepcb::library::ComponentCategory): Described [here](#doc_library_categories)
- [Package Category](@ref librepcb::library::PackageCategory): Described [here](#doc_library_categories)
- [Symbol](@ref librepcb::library::Symbol): Graphical item which can be added to schematics
- [Package](@ref librepcb::library::Package): Graphical item which can be added to boards.
- [Component](@ref librepcb::library::Component): Describes a generic (abstract) electrical device
- [Device](@ref librepcb::library::Device): Represents a concrete (i.e. purchaseable) electrical device
- SPICE Model: *Planned, but not yet implemented...*

Following diagram shows these elements (except the two category elements) and how they work together:

To get a better idea of how this works in practice, here some examples:

# File Structure {#doc_library_file_structure}

A LibrePCB library is represented by a regular directory on the file system. All metadata and
library elements are stored in files and subdirectories of the library's root directory.

Library directories have the suffix `.lplib` to easily recognize directories as LibrePCB libraries.

This tree shows the structure of a library directory:

    MyLibrary.lplib/
    ├── .librepcb-lib
    ├── library.png
    ├── library.xml
    ├── cmp/

## .librepcb-lib

This file indicates that the directory is a LibrePCB library and also contains the file format version.
See [File Format Versioning] for more information about LibrePCB's file format versioning system.

## library.png

This (optional) picture is displayed on different locations in the graphical user interface (e.g. in
the library manager). The dimensions of the image should be 256x256 pixels.

## library.xml

This file contains some metadata about the library itself (e.g. name, author, dependencies).

## cmp, cmpcat, dev, pkg, pkgcat, sym

These directories contain all the library elements:

- `cmp`: Components (librepcb::library::Component)
- `cmpcat`: Component Categories (librepcb::library::ComponentCategory)
- `dev`: Devices (librepcb::library::Device)
- `pkg`: Packages (librepcb::library::Package)
- `pkgcat`: Package Categories (librepcb::library::PackageCategory)
- `sym`: Symbols (librepcb::library::Symbol)

All of these directories are optional. For example if a library does not provide any Symbols, the
`sym` directory may not exist.

Each library element inside these directories is represented by a subdirectory whose name
corresponds to the element's [UUID]. The element directories contain following files:

- An identification file (e.g. `.librepcb-cmp`) used for [File Format Versioning].
- An XML file (e.g. `component.xml`) containing the actual library element (metadata, geometry, ...).
- Depending on the element type, there may be more files (e.g. 3D models for Packages).


# Identification of Library Elements {#doc_library_identification}

Each library element (and also the library itself) gets a [UUID] at their creation. This [UUID] is
then used to identify these elements. For example a librepcb::library::Device refers to a
librepcb::library::Package with the [UUID] of the package. This allows to combine library elements
even across different libraries (e.g. the Device and Package from the last example can be located
in different libraries).

To avoid broken dependencies, two rules need to be followed:

- The [UUID] of each library element must never change.
- The "interface" of each library element must never change. For example the interface of a
  librepcb::library::Symbol is defined by their pins ([UUID] and meaning of every pin). If the count,
  [UUID] or the meaning of pins changes, all librepcb::library::Component which have references to
  that librepcb::library::Symbol will break their functionality.

If one of these things needs to be changed, this must be done by creating a new element (with a new
[UUID]) and (optionally) marking the original element as deprecated.


# Internationalization of Library Elements {#doc_library_i18n}

Each library element must contain English (`en_US`) texts (name, description, keywords, ...), other
languages are optional. The user can define his preferred language in his workspace settings to make
LibrePCB show all library elements in that language (if available). English is always the fallback
language if the desired language is not available.


# Categorization of Library Elements {#doc_library_categories}

LibrePCB uses category elements to categorize all other library elements. Category elements are like
normal library elements, but cannot be used in schematics or boards. Their only purpose is to
provide a category tree over all libraries, where all the other, regular library elements can be
assigned to unlimited many of these categories.

This system allows the user to choose regular elements (like a librepcb::library::Component in a
librepcb::project::Schematic) by browsing through that category tree.

![Relation between categories and regular library elements](library_structure_overview.png)

There exist two types of categories, while all regular element types use exactly one of them:

- librepcb::library::ComponentCategory (e.g. "Diodes", "Resistors", ...) is used for:
    - librepcb::library::Symbol
    - librepcb::library::Component
    - librepcb::library::Device
    - *SPICE Model, once implemented...*
- librepcb::library::PackageCategory (e.g. "DIP", "TQFP", "BGA", ...) is used for:
    - librepcb::library::Package


# Dependencies {#doc_library_dependencies}

A library can have dependencies to other libraries. Therefore, a library needs to provide a list of
library [UUID]s it depends on. We do not track dependencies between each single library element
(Symbol, Component, ...) because that would be too complicated. We also do not take care of the
required minimal library version of dependencies, because that would be hard to determine and
maintain. The user should just update all his libraries at once to avoid broken dependencies.

This simple system also requires to forbid removing elements from existing libraries, because this
could break other libraries. So when a library element should no longer be used, it must be marked
as deprecated instead of removing it.
